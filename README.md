		React is used to build user interfaces (UI) on the front end.
	</li>
	<li>React is the view layer of an MVC application (Model View Controller)
	</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most important aspects of React is the fact that you can create components, which are like custom, reusable HTML elements, to quickly and efficiently build user interfaces. React also streamlines how data is stored and handled, using state and props.</p>

<p>Imported Packages for a static React App</p>
<ul>
	<li>React - The React top level API</li>
	<li>React DOM - adds DOM-specific methods</li>
	<li>Babel - A Javascript compiler that lets us use ES6+ in old browsers</li>
</ul>

<p>The entry point for our app will be the root div element, which is named by convention. You'll also notice the text/babel script type, which is mandatory for using Babel</p>
